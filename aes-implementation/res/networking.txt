Answer: Between OSI reference model and TCP/IP reference model, I find OSI model better.

Reason: As we know, the OSI model has 3 core concepts which are services(defines what a layer does), interfaces(defines how different layers within a machine communicate with one another within same machine), and protocols(defines how 2 distinct machines communicate with each other).
So, OSI model has quite a well-defined strcture.
On the other hand, TCP/IP model has some limitations. Firstly, the concepts on services, interfaces and protocols are not well-defined and they are not distinguished. Secondly, TCP/IP is not a generalized model. Also, its "host-to-network" layer is not an actual layer. It defines some functionality of datalink and physical layers of OSI model but they are not well-defined and the layer varies from host to host. But, according to the definition of layer, it must have a well-defined functionality.
Again, in this model. minor protocols are deeply entrenched as a result of problematic and non-industry-standard code provided by its inexperienced developers. These minor protocols and buggy code were quite hard to replace. 

Well, both the models considered here have their good and bad sides. But, in my point of view, a well-defined structure is a must for doing such sophisticated task as managing the netowrk of communication. Hence, I think OSI model is better than TCP/IP model.
