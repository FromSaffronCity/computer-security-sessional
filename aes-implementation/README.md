# aes-implementation  
This repository contains program coded for implementation of AES encryption-decryption algorithm for 128bits key **(Offline-1)**.  
## navigation  
- ```./1605023.py``` file contains the AES implementation  
- ```./inputs/``` directory contains input key and text files  
- ```./res/``` directory contains sample files for file encryption-decryption  
  **(You can use your own files for this purpose, but make sure the files are relatively small sized if you value your time!)**  
## guideline  
- you will find how to run the code inside ```./1605023.py```
